Fundamentals of Data Analytics - Credit card fraudulent case prediction

A financial institution seeks to detect potential fraud cases in credit card transactions. Analyse
transaction data using a combination of linear algebra and statistical techniques. Utilize linear
algebra to represent transaction data as vectors and matrices. Apply statistical methods,
including anomaly detection algorithms, to identify irregular transaction patterns indicative
of fraud. Develop algorithms or models to flag suspicious transactions for further
investigation. Sample data: Transaction ID, Date, Time, Amount, Merchant, Card Number,
Transaction Type.

Solve problems using derivatives, transcendental functions, and integration, integrate
the concepts of foundations of data analytics for problem solving.
